Originally commissioned as a military force the UNSC was once responsible for the overseeing of space battles and the suppression of insurrections. \n\nAs humanity spread through space it was inevitable that other species would be encountered. Now, faced with the potential for extinction, the UNSC has become humanity's primary government and its best hope for survival."
